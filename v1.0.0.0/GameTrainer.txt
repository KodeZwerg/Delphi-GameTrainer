Welcome to my Windows GameTrainer Engine v1.0 beta by KodeZwerg.- Requirements:    any Windows Vista or newer    specific Target Game    about 10-15 MB free RAM    DirectX 9 - DirectSound to playback Music- Trained Game Info:    Name:             Yu-Gi-Oh! - Power of Chaos - Joey the Passion    Version:          1.6    Filename:         joey_pc.exe    Filesize in byte: 3919872    Trainer Options:  5    CRC:              included    Version Control:  not included    Registry Fix:     included- Trained this:    KI and User Points. (KI = upper Player, User = lower Player)    If Freeze KI is set to 0 points = Auto-Win every round    Freeze User to more than highest damage enemy could inflict with one attack = God-Mode    if you wonder why not just two options (god and win)    it is simple explained, sometimes this game hardly depends on points (to give/take/loose bonus)    to test all possibilities out, i have included editing functionality in this release    btw press enter after you have edited a value to apply changes    btw in game you will not see the set points, no worry, they are applied.- Legend:    target  / target.exe  = targets process or filename    trainer / trainer.exe = trainers process or filename- F.requently A.sked Q.uestions:  Q: Whats the point?  A: This application is designed to cheat in a game by patching proper memory adresses.  Q: How it works?  A: Just follow onscreen stuff, its pretty easy to understand. Read below for detailed methods.  Q: Why is filesize that big, earlier Trainers from you where just about 30kb?  A: Ask Embarcadero (producer of Delphi, in wich this application is made)     Earlier i used pure Windows API programming, wich results in small files.     Now i wanted a bit more style and lazy drag & drop my Dialog Window together :-)     FYI, the methods i used at WinAPI are the same that i use now, just updated here and there.     About 2 MB Music Data is included aswell, (9 different tracks).     (music is in shared places, some are in files resource section, rest somewhere in file)     (feel free to rip music, but its easier to get originals for free via internet      since i converted them all to smaller ones and removed headers...)  Q: My AntiVirus and/or Firewall warns me, now what?  A: I guess you have an infected file, get a clean copy.     The original Trainer is not protected - AntiVirus conform.     The original Trainer does not use any Internet/LAN connection.  Q: Why are some controls grayed?  A: Either i did not used them at all or the time to use has not come yet.     (The Trainer itself is just a re-usable template,      original template has just checkboxes / no edit functions.)  Q: Why can i not un-/check filesize, crc, version and found process checkbox?  A: Exactly. They are meant to display status and not to edit/tweak something.     I do not liked the gray display to avoid/suppress user clicks.  Q: Is it okay to run trainer from usb and disconnect usb while trainer is active?  A: In theory = Yes. I have set up executable to copy itself into swap file.     But you never know for sure how Microsoft Windows works...  Q: Trainer does not let me cheat, what is the matter?  A: Take a look at Trainers Status section.     If not all 4 left checkboxes are checked than your copy of target mismatch mine.     To protect yourself in that situation, i disable all trainer activities.     Checkbox Found Process: if unchecked than you have not got at all the proper game running.     Checkbox Filesize: if unchecked your copy differs from mine.     Checkbox CRC: if unchecked your copy differs from mine.     Checkbox Version: if unchecked your copy differs from mine.     Filesize, CRC and Version reasons:       Filesize is the fastest way to check if we nearly have the same copy.       CRC is the ultimate way to be sure.       Neverless of above i have included additional version information comparision.       If one of those does not match,       your version might be patched where memory locations are different.       If you still want to try, read Command Line section in this text.  Q: Trainer do not find Target, but it IS running, what is the problem?  A: Trainer is restricted to use only Target Process if it was run from same Login-account.     This prevents errors/unwanted behavior for other logged in Users.  Q: Trainer does not accept Hotkey? I keep pressing but nothing happen!  A: Trainer just activate Hotkey(s) if you have either Target or Trainer focused.     If something else got focus, Hotkey(s) are skipped to protect yourself.  Q: I try to run Trainer.exe but nothing happen?  A: Trainer can just be started once (from each Login-account), check Taskbar.     Usualy Trainers Window should come to foreground when launched.     btw it makes no sense to rename Trainer.exe to run it multiple times, it will not happen.- Known Bugs:      - when running target more than once, my trainer just affect any found instance.      you can not cheat in several games at same time, sorry.      i might add a dialog box where you can choose wich process(es) my trainer should attack.    - i have implemented some kind of "numlock-lock"      that means, when trainer starts, it set numlock to "on"      if you accidently press numlock ingame, it will instant turn on again      bug: if you switch to any other window and turn numlock off,           at this point my lock works unfortunately vice versa           to me it is a minor bug, since hotkeys are numpad numbers,           it is better to have a "maby" bug instead of no feature at all :-)    - sometimes a wrong icon is used- Usage:    - copy trainer.exe and trainer.txt anywhere (game directory with target.exe is a good place)    - run trainer    - press run button or load your game anyhow    - if game is loaded you can either return to trainer to edit or stay in game and use hotkeys    - that is all you need to know, happy cheating- Command Line switches:    (command line switches are NOT implemented by now, all below is on my todo list!)    - -NoFilesize = filesize checking will be disabled    - -NoCRC = crc checking will be disabled    - -Freeze# = auto freeze hotkey # after process is found                 my hotkeys are CONTROL + SHIFT + # (# = a number)                 watch in my trainer dialog wich number does what.    - -NoSound = turn off all sounds that trainer could make    - -Target"Executable" = uses "Executable" as target    - -AutoRun = runs target when you run trainer    later releases might have a create link dialog where you can set above features.- Best practice with Command Line switches:    (command line switches are NOT implemented by now, all below is on my todo list!)     After successful creating a Desktop Link, right click that icon and choose properties.     Target is where we need to add switches, like:       Example to freeze hotkey # 1 as soon as trainer detects process:       "X:\Path to trainer\Trainer.exe" "-Freeze1"       Example to autorun target when you run trainer:       "X:\Path to trainer\Trainer.exe" "-aUTOrUN"       Example to run without checking target:       "X:\Path to trainer\Trainer.exe" "-nOcRc" "-NoFiLeSiZe"     Command Line switches are not case-sensitive and can be in any order.- General Controls & Methods explained:  - Button Run:      if Trainer knows location of Target.exe and Target is not running,      this button will be enabled and if you press it, guess what happen.      Best way to let Trainer know correct location of Target.exe is:       Run Trainer, run Target, press "Create Desktop Link"       from now on just run the link and Trainer knows where Target hides :-)  - Button Create Desktop Link:      as soon as trainer detects a running copy of target.exe this button will be enabled      (or as soon as trainer knows location of target.exe)      a desktop icon for trainer.exe will be created to work with target.exe  - Button Update Registry:      Trainer needs to be run as Administrator for this feature.      (right click on Trainers Desktop link an choose Run as Administrator)      as soon as trainer detects a running copy of target.exe this button will be enabled      (or as soon as trainer knows location of target.exe)      if it is enabled, i have included some basic registry stuff to update/fix registry      (same as in my 30kb version, useful if you just copied game files instead installing)      if it is always grayed than i have not included any in this release      i am using an elevation check to be able to write registry stuff  - Button Open Readme:      You guessed right.      It will self enable/disable, depends on situation.      If it is enabled, Trainer found a Trainer.txt file either in Trainers or Targets folder      and no Notepad process with Trainer.txt is loaded/found.      (actually it look for any notepad with any Trainer.txt opened)      If you rename Trainer.exe you also need to rename Trainer.txt!  - Music Checkbox:      turn music on/off      it auto-stop when you are in game      if it is always grayed than i have not included any in this release      All Music is made and/or (c) by their respective owners, i just optimized data.      btw Music Volume is 30% drained to not shock you :-]
